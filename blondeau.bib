	abstract={Automatic testing constitutes an important part of everyday development practice. Worldline, a major IT company, is creating more and more tests to ensure the good behavior of its applications and gains in efficiency and quality. But running all these tests may take hours. This is especially true for large systems involving, for example, the deployment of a web server or communication with a database. For this reason, tests are not launched as often as they should be and are mostly run at night. The company wishes to improve its development and testing process by giving to developers rapid feedback after a change. An interesting solution is to reduce the number of tests to run by identifying only those exercising the piece of code changed. Two main approaches are proposed in the literature: static and dynamic. The static approach creates a model of the source code and explores it to find links between changed methods and tests. The dynamic approach records invocations of methods during the execution of test scenarios. Before deploying a test case selection solution, Worldline created a partnership with us to investigate the situation in its projects and to evaluate these approaches on three industrial, closed source, cases to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each solution. We propose a classification of problems that may arise when trying to identify the tests that cover a method. We give concrete examples of these problems and list some possible solutions. We also evaluate other issues such as the impact on the results of the frequency of modification of methods or considering groups of methods instead of single ones. We found that solutions must be combined to obtain better results, and problems have different impacts on projects. Considering commits instead of individual methods tends to worsen the results, perhaps due to their large size.},

 	Abstract = {Nowadays, Worldline, a major IT company, develops application that are dealing with an increasing amount of critical data with a source code is more and more complex. To the stay in the race against its competitors, Worldline has to increase the quality of its projects. One transversal team of the company has for main mission to enhance project quality. By joining this team, we performed an audit of several projects of the company to identify how to avoid project failure. Relying on project metadata analysis, interviews, survey, and literature study, this audit drew no final conclusion. However, it highlighted a need to enhance testing usage. To test every piece of code is compulsory to avoid project failure. In industry and more specifically in Worldline, automation of tests has begun to ensure the proper behavior of their applications. But, ensuring the execution of all tests after a change can be a costly operation requiring several hours. However, in a daily development process, developers can not run all the tests after a change to check the impact of their modifications. Feedback on the changed code is delayed and developer have to spent time to discover the potential bugs. A late feedback can potentially lead to the failure of a project.
 	The solution generally proposed in literature consists in reducing the number of tests to run by selecting only the ones related to the last changes made by the developer. The approach selects a suitable and small set of tests to detect potential regression in the application behavior.
 	Test selection approaches have their own advantages and drawbacks. These approaches need to be studied in the context of Worldline and consequently adapted to suit developers habits. Before integrating such an adapted test selection approach, a study of the testing behavior of the developers have been done to get their current test selection usage. This study will monitor all the tests launched by the developers during their everyday development tasks. Based on the study of the Worldline environment, we developed a tool for the developers aiming to perform test selection. It is adapted to the developers habits and is directly usable by them. The goal is also to study the impact of this tool on their behavior. We hope that the test selection approach that is packaged in a tool adapted to the Worldline developers will bring a change in their development process.},
